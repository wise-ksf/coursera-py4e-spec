Notes on Choice of Text Editor

We recommend that you use the Atom text editor for this course. We prefer it because it works the same on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. All of the course demonstration videos use Atom. You can download and install it from:

https://atom.io/

If you do use Atom, be aware that user input is not supported when scripts are run from the editor rather than the command line.

If you already have a text editor like TextWrangler/SublimeText on the Macintosh and NotePad++ on Windows they can be used for this course. 

Ways to take screenshots:

Grap.app
Preview.app: File->Take Screenshot

You can also use Command-Shift-4 and then select an area of the screen to take a screen shot.

If You Want to Learn More

This chapter covers networking at a very high level. If you want to learn more, there is both a free book and a Coursera course that I would recommend:

    Introduction to Networking (free textbook)
http://www.net-intro.com/
    Internet History, Technology, and Security (Coursera Course)
https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-history

Neither of these is essential for this course or the Python Specialization as we quickly move from how the network works to how to write Python code using the urllib library - which makes the very complex Internet protocols exceedingly simple.

Notes Regarding the Use of BeautifulSoup

The sample code for this course and textbook examples use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML. The examples in the textbook and in this class work with BeautifulSoup 3.

Using BeautifulSoup 3

If you want use our samples "as is", download our Python 3 version of BeautifulSoup 3 from

http://www.py4e.com/code3/bs4.zip

You must unzip this into a "bs4" folder and have that folder as a sub-folder of the folder where you put our sample code like:
